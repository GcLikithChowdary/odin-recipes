        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Beef Wellington is a luxurious and iconic dish that showcases the perfect marriage of tender beef, rich flavors, and elegant presentation. At its core, it consists of a beef tenderloin coated with a layer of pâté (often mushroom duxelles) and sometimes prosciutto, all wrapped in puff pastry and baked to golden perfection. The dish is believed to have been named after Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, and has since become a symbol of fine dining. When sliced, the Beef Wellington reveals a stunning cross-section of juicy, medium-rare beef encased in a crisp, flaky pastry shell, making it a show-stopping centerpiece for special occasions.

            What makes Beef Wellington so special is its intricate preparation and balance of textures and flavors. The mushroom duxelles, made from finely chopped mushrooms, shallots, and herbs, adds an earthy depth, while the prosciutto or pâté provides a savory richness. The puff pastry seals in the moisture of the beef, ensuring it remains tender and succulent. Though it requires precision and patience to prepare, the result is a dish that is as impressive to look at as it is delicious to eat. Beef Wellington is often served with sides like roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a red wine reduction, making it a complete and unforgettable meal.

            <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (for searing)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons English mustard (e.g., Coleman's)</li>
            <li>8 oz (225g) mushrooms (cremini or button), finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>4-6 slices prosciutto</li>
            <li>1 sheet puff pastry (thawed if frozen)</li>
            <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
            <li>Flour (for dusting)</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Season the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat and sear the beef on all sides until browned (about 2-3 minutes per side).</li>
            <li>Brush the seared beef with English mustard and let it cool.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, sauté the mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme until the mixture is dry and pasty (this is the duxelles). Let it cool.</li>
            <li>Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap and arrange the prosciutto slices in a slightly overlapping layer.</li>
            <li>Spread the mushroom duxelles evenly over the prosciutto.</li>
            <li>Place the beef in the center and use the plastic wrap to roll the prosciutto and duxelles tightly around the beef. Chill for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface until large enough to wrap the beef.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the beef and place it in the center of the pastry. Fold the pastry around the beef, sealing the edges with egg wash.</li>
            <li>Place the wrapped beef seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Brush the pastry with egg wash and score the top lightly with a knife for decoration.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the internal temperature of the beef reaches 120-125°F (49-52°C) for medium-rare.</li>
            <li>Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
          </ol>
