        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a beloved comfort food worldwide. It consists of multiple layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich fillings, typically including a savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or pork, is simmered with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs like basil and oregano, creating a robust and flavorful base. Between the layers, a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses adds a creamy, gooey texture, while the béchamel sauce provides a smooth, velvety richness. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until the top is golden and bubbling, resulting in a hearty, indulgent dish that is perfect for sharing.

        <p>What makes lasagna so versatile is its adaptability to various dietary preferences and regional variations. Vegetarian versions might include layers of roasted vegetables, spinach, or mushrooms, while seafood lasagna incorporates shrimp or salmon for a unique twist. In some regions of Italy, lasagna is made without tomatoes, relying instead on a rich ragu and béchamel. Gluten-free and low-carb alternatives use zucchini or eggplant slices in place of pasta, catering to modern dietary needs. Whether served as a family dinner, at gatherings, or as a leftover treat, lasagna's layers of flavor and texture make it a timeless favorite that continues to evolve while staying true to its comforting roots.
